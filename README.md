# Project Idea
Starting as a web app, it will allow local hobby clubs to market themselves to new members\
and allow new users to quickly find the right club for them.

# Project Background
As someone who have tried to look for the right clubs and now a member of a few clubs this software\
could have really helped me in a some areas. It is quite difficult to look for clubs near my area that\
was what I wanted. Unless the city name is in the club name, more often than not, the club will not show up\
even when searched online.

The aim of this project is to help local users to find clubs that perfectly fit them but also\
help new clubs or struggling clubs to gain new members without having to commit to a full-blown website.
